# Multi-Disciplinary Analysis (MDA)

This section explains about aircraft multi-disciplinary analysis (CADE-MDA) module inside CADE platform.

<br>

## What is Multi-Disciplinary Analysis

**Multi-Disciplinary Analysis (MDA)** of an aircraft is an engineering approach that integrates various fields-such as aircraft configuration, weight and balance, aerodynamics, stability and control, and propulsion-into unified design framework. By coupling different modules, MDA supports system-level optmization and rapid design iteration in complex aircraft development.

## Program Structure

CADE-MDA is available of both <span style="color:rgb(24, 80, 145);">'Integrated Analysis'</span> and <span style="color:rgb(24, 80, 145);">'Standalone Analysis' of each discipline. 

You can find program structure at the link below :

## Input Files

There are two main input files to run CADE Multi-Disciplinary Analysis.

### > Command Input

The first one is **'Command Input File'**, which controls the whole analysis :

- Which <span style="color:rgb(24, 80, 145);">'AIRCRAFT'</span> will be analyzed ?
- Which engineering <span style="color:rgb(24, 80, 145);">'DISCIPLINE'</span> is considered in the multi-disciplinary analysis ?
- Which type of <span style="color:rgb(24, 80, 145);">'ANALYSIS'</span> is performed within each discipline ?
- How are the analysis <span style="color:rgb(24, 80, 145);">'CONDITIONS'</span> defined ?

You can find more detailed explanations and examples of the command input file at the link below :

- [Command Input File to Run CADE-MDA](cmd_input.rst)

### > Aircraft Input

Another input file required for the analysis is the **'Aircraft Input File'**, which contains detailed information and data about the target aircraft to be analyzed.

This file contains information on the aircraft's <span style="color:rgb(24, 80, 145);">geometry, internal components, and propulsion system.</span>

You can find more detailed explanations and examples of the aircraft input file at the link below :
