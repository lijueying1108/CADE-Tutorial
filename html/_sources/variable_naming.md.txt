# Variable Names

All variable names are words ```separated_with_underscores```.
For example ```motor_power```

Constants should be in CAPS separated with underscores
```GRAVITY_ACCELERATION```.

## General convention

The following variable naming convention should be used:

1. Parameter name (mass, power, thrust, etc.)
2. Parameter descriptor (motor, propeller, baggage, etc.)
3. Prefix (min, max, avg, total)
4. Unit, if not SI

```python
mass_propulsion_total
thrust_total_lbf
thrust_avg
```

### Prefixes and aggregations

Use only approved aggregations listed in this document

- maximum ```max```
- minimum ```min```
- average ```avg```
- index ```idx```
- input ```inp```
- output ```out```
- required ```req```
- installation ```install```
- horizontal stabilizer (tail) ```hstab```
- vertical stabilizer ```vstab```
- location ```loc```
- dynamic ```dyn```
- geometrical coordinates
  - fuselage station ```FS```
  - water line ```WL```
  - butt line ```BL```

Put the abbreviations at the end of the variable name
```velocity_avg```

### Units

By default keep all the units in SI system! If variable is not in SI
add the unit at the end of the variable name

Example: ```velocity_avg_kts```

### Number of items

Use words **number of** for total number of items and **index** to
 refer to a specific item. Avoid use of word **total** in this context.

- ```num_of_motors``` - total number of motors
- ```idx_motor``` - specific index of the motor (1st or 5th)

### Total

Use word **total** for uncountable nouns. Like ```mass_total```

## Variable and Function

Variables are nouns ```mass, lift, aircraft```

Functions are verbs ```calculate, set, plot, save```

## Common abbreviations

List all the abbreviations used in the code here

- battery ```batt```
- system ```sys```
- efficiency ```effy```
- coefficient ```coef```
- distance ```dist```
- length ```len```
- diameter ```diam```
- fuselage ```fus```
- fraction ```frac```
- structure ```struct```
