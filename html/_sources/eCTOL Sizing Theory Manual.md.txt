eCTOL Sizing Theory Manual
This is the manual for electric conventional takeoff and landing sizing manual

## General Overview
Instead of tradional sizing process, which find the required P/W, T/W based on the requirements, we used optimization appraoch which finds the design requirements with the variables of P/W, W/S and Mass input values. 
An optimization formulaiton can be written as,

$\min_{P/W, W/S, MTOW_{in}} \ MTOW_{out}$\
$\text{subject to}\notag \\$
$MTOW_{in} - MTOW_{out} \leq \epsilon$\
$V_{stall_{out}} \leq V_{stall_{req}}$\
$ROC_{max_{calc}} \geq ROC_{max_{req}}$\
...\
...\
other constraints parameters that is defined by user requirements. 

## Performance Requirements Calcualtion
Performance requirements such as maximum climb rate, cruise speed can be calculated based on our design variables of P/W, W/S and MTOW_{in} values.
### Steady Level Flight Conditions
A cruise condition can be set for different conditions. 

$ T = D $ \
$ L = W $
#### Thrust required, Power required and P/W calculation
Thrust required, Power required, Lift required can be defined from cruise speed and wing loading conditions.

$C_{L_{req}} = 2 (W/S) \rho V_{cruise}^2$\
$C_D = CD_0 + k C_{L_{req}}^2$\
$ T_{req} = D = 1/2 \rho V_{cruise}^2 \frac{1}{(W/S)} W_{in} C_D$\
$ P_{req}/W_{in} = \frac{T_{req} V_{cruise}}{\eta_{prop}} $\
$ P_{req} = (P/W) W_{in}$

#### Maximum Endurance Speed 

Find the speed for maximum endurance condition. \
$ V_{E_{max}} = \sqrt{(2/\rho) (W/S) \sqrt{\frac{k}{3 C_{D_{0}}}}}$\
$ V_{cruise}  =V_{E_{max}}$

#### Maximum Endurance Speed 

Find the speed for maximum range condition.\

$ V_{R_{max}} = \sqrt{(2/\rho) (W/S) \sqrt{\frac{k}{C_{D_{0}}}}}$\
$ V_{cruise}  =V_{R_{max}}$

#### Maximum Speed 
Find the airspeed for maximum speed condition. Maximum speed can be find as a funciton of P/W and W/S. Since the equaiton cannot solve manually, so we applied Newoton Raphson methods to find the maximum speed. [^fn]

$\eta_{prop} (P/W) = 0.5 \rho V_{max}^3 1/(W/S) C_{D_{0}} + \frac{2k (W/S)}{\rho V_{max}} $\
$V_{cruise} = V_{max}$

### Climb and Descent Conditions
A climb condition can be set for different conditions. \
$ T = W \sin \theta + D $ \
$ L = W \cos \theta $

#### Thrust required, Power required and P/W calculation
Thrust required, Power required, Lift required can be defined from cruise speed and wing loading conditions.

$C_{L_{req}} = 2 (W/S) \rho V_{climb}^2 \cos \theta $\
$ C_D = CD_0 + k C_{L_{req}}^2$\
$ T_{req} = W \sin \theta + D $\
$ T_{req}  = W_{in} \sin \theta + 1/2 \rho V_{cruise}^2 \frac{1}{(W/S)} W_{in} C_D $\
$ P_{req}/W_{in} = \frac{T_{req} V_{cruise}}{\eta_{prop}} $\
$ P_{req} = (P/W) W_{in}$

#### Maximum Rate of Climb Condition
A maximum rate of climb condition can be found at maximum lift to drag ratio and maximum excess power conditions. A maximum lift to drag ratio speed can be written as, 

$V_{LD_{max}} = \sqrt{2/\rho (W/S) \sqrt{\frac{k}{3 C_{D_{0}}}}}$ \
$LD_{max}    =  \frac{1}{4 C_{D_{0} k}}$\
$ROC_{max}   = \eta_{prop} (P/W) - V_{LD_{max}} \frac{1.1547}{LD_{max}}$\
$\theta      = \sin^{-1} (\frac{ROC_{max}}{V_{LD_{max}}})$\
$ V_{climb}  = V_{LD_{max}}$

#### Stall Speed Condtion
A stall speed can be calculated as a function of wingloading

$ V_{stall} = \sqrt{\frac{2 (W/S)}{\rho C_{L_{max}}}}$

#### Takeoff Condition 
A takeoff condition is defined which is calculated based on lift off speed, P/W and W/S. A ground roll distance is calculated.

$V_{liftoff} = 1.2 V_{stall}$\
$V_{field} = \frac{V_{liftoff}}{\sqrt{2}}$\
$S_{g} = \frac{V_{liftoff}^2}{2 g (\eta_{prop}/V_{field}(P/W)+q \ 1/(W/S)(\mu C_{L_{TO}}-C_{D_{TO}}-\mu))}$


## Total mass calculation
In this calculaiton, we consisder for Energy mass calcualtion, Propulison mass calculaiton, Structural, Subsystems and Avionics mass. 

### Energy Mass Calculaiton 
Energy mass can be divided for hydrogen fuel cell and battery mass. 
In this version, we only consisder for battery mass. A battery mass can be estimated depending on specific energy density, energy required of our aircraft mission. 

$ Energy_{battery} = \frac{Energy_{req}}{f_{usable}\eta_{battery}}$\

$ mass_{battery} = \frac{Energy_{battery}}{E_{spec}}$

### Propulsion Mass Calculation
Propulsion mass for motor, inverter are used as regression model from competitor data.
#### Motor Regression Model
Motor mass is estimated based on maximum power required. 

$ mass_{motor} = 0.208 P_{max_{kw}} + 2.23 $

### Inverter Regression Model
Invertor mass is estimated based on maximum power required.

$ mass_{inverter} = 0.0553 P_{max_{kw}} + 1.721$

### Propeller Model
Propeller mass is estimated based on diameter of propeller.
Propeller diameter is calculated. [^fn]
$ mass_{prop} = 1.1 {(D_{prop} P_{max_{kw}}\sqrt{N_{b}})^{0.52}}$ [^ref]\

$ D_{prop} = k_{p} P_{max_{kw}}^{0.25}$\
$k_{p}$ is 0.56 for 2 blades propeller.\
$k_{p}$ is 0.52 for 3 blades propelelr.\
$k_{p}$ is 0.49 for propeller's blades between 3 and 6.\

## Mission Energy Required Calcaultion
Mission energy required is calculated depending on user mission profile and calcuated the power required of each mission segements and as well as mission energy.

$Energy_{misison} = \sum_{i=0}^{i=Seg} {P_{i} t_{i}}$
