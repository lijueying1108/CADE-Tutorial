## Program Structure

You can find program structure at the link below :

- [Program Structure of CADE-MDA](program_structure.md)

<br>

## Input Files

There are two main input files to run CADE Design Evaluation, same as CADE-MDA.

### Command Input

The first one is **'Command Input File'**, which controls the whole analysis :

- Which <span style="color:rgb(24, 80, 145);">'AIRCRAFT'</span> will be analyzed ?
- Which engineering <span style="color:rgb(24, 80, 145);">'DISCIPLINE'</span> is considered in the multi-disciplinary analysis ?
- Which type of <span style="color:rgb(24, 80, 145);">'ANALYSIS'</span> is performed within each discipline ?
- How are the analysis <span style="color:rgb(24, 80, 145);">'CONDITIONS'</span> defined ?

You can find more detailed explanations and examples of the command input file at the link below :

- [Command Input File to Run CADE-MDA](cmd_input.rst)

### Aircraft Input

Another input file required for the analysis is the **'Aircraft Input File'**, which contains detailed information and data about the target aircraft to be analyzed.

This file contains information on the aircraft's <span style="color:rgb(24, 80, 145);">geometry, internal components, and propulsion system.</span>

You can find more detailed explanations and examples of the aircraft input file at the link below :
