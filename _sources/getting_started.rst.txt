Getting started
===============

ADSP is written in Python 3. Currently ADSP is working without 
installation. The code is provided as a folder (archive). 

Full installation setup is planned for future versions. 

Directory structure
-------------------

::

    adsp
    |   .gitignore
    |   requirements.txt
    |   README.md
    +---adsp
    |   |   analysis_source_codes
    +---bin
    +---data
    |   |   csv databases
    +---doc
    |   |   user's manual
    |   |   theory manual
    +---output
    |   |   results of analysis
    +---temp
    +---tests
    |   |   test runcases

The code execution is fully controlled from a single csv (spreadsheet) 
file. *data* folder contains several examples. Complete structure of 
the *Command input file* is shown in sections below.

Running the code
----------------

The easiest way to run the ADSP is shown below

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: run a script

   import adsp

   # read file from data/sample-cmd.csv
   cmd_input = adsp.ControlInputFile('sample-cmd.csv')

   # initialize the analysis
   analysis = adsp.IntegratedAnalysis()

   # set inputs
   analysis.set_aircraft(cmd_input.aircraft)
   analysis.set_methodology(cmd_input.methodology)

   # run the analysis
   analysis.run(cmd_input.runcases)

   # display the results
   analysis.display_report()

The code will perform full analysis according to inputs in the 
*sample-cmd.csv*, display the results and save markdown and pdf 
reports in the *output* folder

More test cases are located in *tests* folder
