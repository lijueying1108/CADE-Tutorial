Mission Profile Setup
========================

This section describes how to set up a mission profile. Users can define any custom mission profile according to their needs.

The mission profile input data can be found at:

``data/mission_input/mission.xlsx``

Mission profiles can be composed depending on user requirements. This framework offers a variety of mission segments. Users can select any combination of segments to define and run a mission scenario.

Available Mission Segments
----------------------------

The list of mission segments that can be analyzed includes:

``AXIAL_CLIMB_AT_ALTITUDE_AND_SPEED``,  
``AXIAL_CLIMB_AT_ALTITUDE_AND_CLIMB_RATE``,  
``HOVER_AT_ALTITUDE_AND_TIME``,  
``CLIMB_AT_ALTITUDE_AND_SPEED``,  
``CLIMB_AT_ALTITUDE_AND_CLIMB_RATE``,  
``CLIMB_AT_MAX_CLIMB_RATE``,  
``CLIMB_AT_ECONOMICAL_CLIMB``,  
``CRUISE_AT_SPEED_AND_DISTANCE``,  
``LOITER_AT_SPEED_AND_TIME``,  
``CRUISE_AT_MAX_RANGE_SPEED``,  
``CRUISE_AT_MAX_ENDURANCE_SPEED``,  
``DESCENT_AT_ALTITUDE_AND_DESCENT_RATE``,  
``DESCENT_AT_MIN_DESCENT_RATE``,  
``AXIAL_DESCENT_AT_ALTITUDE_AND_SPEED``,  
``AXIAL_DESCENT_AT_ALTITUDE_AND_DESCENT_RATE``

Explanation of Mission Segment Inputs
---------------------------------------

- **nSeg**: Number of subdivisions for each segment. More segments generally improve accuracy.
- **segment**: Segment keyword used to define each mission phase.
- **h start**, **h end**: Starting and ending altitudes [m].
- **V start**, **V end**: Starting and ending speeds [m/s].
- **climb rate**: Vertical climb or descent rate [m/s].
- **range, m**: Horizontal range [m].
- **time, s**: Time duration [s].
- **x**: Marked where input is not required.

Segment Descriptions
-----------------------

- ``AXIAL_CLIMB_AT_ALTITUDE_AND_SPEED``: Vertical (axial) climb at a given altitude and constant VTOL speed.
- ``AXIAL_CLIMB_AT_ALTITUDE_AND_CLIMB_RATE``: Vertical climb at constant altitude and specified climb rate.
- ``HOVER_AT_ALTITUDE_AND_TIME``: Hover at a fixed altitude for a given time.
- ``CLIMB_AT_ALTITUDE_AND_SPEED``: Climb between two altitudes with specified start and end speeds.
- ``CLIMB_AT_ALTITUDE_AND_CLIMB_RATE``: Climb between altitudes at constant climb rate.
- ``CLIMB_AT_MAX_CLIMB_RATE``: Climb at the maximum possible climb rate.
- ``CLIMB_AT_ECONOMICAL_CLIMB``: Climb optimized for minimum fuel consumption.
- ``CRUISE_AT_SPEED_AND_DISTANCE``: Cruise at a given speed and distance.
- ``LOITER_AT_SPEED_AND_TIME``: Loiter at specified speed for a given time.
- ``CRUISE_AT_MAX_RANGE_SPEED``: Cruise segment optimized for maximum range.
- ``CRUISE_AT_MAX_ENDURANCE_SPEED``: Cruise segment optimized for maximum endurance.
- ``DESCENT_AT_ALTITUDE_AND_DESCENT_RATE``: Descent at constant altitude with given descent rate.
- ``DESCENT_AT_MIN_DESCENT_RATE``: Descent at the minimum descent rate.
- ``AXIAL_DESCENT_AT_ALTITUDE_AND_SPEED``: Vertical descent at a given speed and altitude.
- ``AXIAL_DESCENT_AT_ALTITUDE_AND_DESCENT_RATE``: Vertical descent at constant altitude and rate.
