# Development History

ADSP development has started 15+ years ago. During this period many
analysis methods were developed and used for academic and industry
projects.

The New ADSP development restarted in August 2021. Centralized software
development system was created. The aim of The New ADSP is to release
a leading product for aircraft analysis, design and optimization.

The New ADSP has continuous development, delivery and continuous
version numbering.

## Old Versions

The current version is written in Python 3. The older ADSP versions are
listed below.

1. Set of codes and scripts written mainly in Fortran.

2. Integrated analysis framework written in MATLAB. This version got
major upgrade incorporating propeller analysis, optimization with
uncertainties and other advanced features. The code was primarily used
for design of KLA-100 aircraft.

3. Fully rewritten in Python 2.7 with internal name of actools (aircraft
toolbox).

4. actools has multiple forks developed for different projects
performed by KADA
   - UCAV
   - fighter jet
   - eVTOL
   - Hydrogen powered eVTOL

5. The New ADSP (current version) is a code with fully revised
development environment and software architecture. This version has
inherited analysis methods from actools-hyfly (Hydrogen Fuel Cell
powered eVTOL-UAV)
