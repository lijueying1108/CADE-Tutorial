# Aerodynamics, Stability and Control User Manual

To perform aerodynamic and SnC analysis, the analysis method and conditions need to be set through the command line (CMD) used for analysis.

## **Methodology Settings**
- DISCIPLINE : aerodynamics
- drag-analysis : friction
  - Uses the friction program to calculate the parasite drag coefficient
  - This calculation is performed during VLM analysis
  - Currently, only the friction method is available
- airfoil-analysis: xfoil / javafoil
  - Provides aerodynamic coefficient data of the airfoil, required for wingstrip analysis, lift curve plot analysis, and Viterna analysis
  - Two methods, XFOIL and JavaFoil, are provided
  - By default, JavaFoil analysis is used
- aircraft-analysis: AVL / HETLAS
  - Used when performing aerodynamic analysis in other modules
  - Determines which method to use when aerodynamic coefficient data is required in other analyses
  - By default, AVL analysis is used
- high-angle-analysis: flatplate / Viterna
  - Used when performing aerodynamic analysis in high angle of attack or high sideslip angle regions in other modules
  - Determines which method to use when aerodynamic coefficient data is required in high angle of attack/sideslip regions in other analyses
  - By default, the flatplate method is used
- CL_max_calculation: DATCOM
  - Used when calculating the maximum lift coefficient, stall angle of attack, etc., in other modules.
  - Determines which method to use for these calculations in other analyses.
  - Currently, only DATCOM is provided.
