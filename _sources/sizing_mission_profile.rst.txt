Sizing mission profile
========================


Convential Takeoff and Landing Mission Profile
----------------------------------

This section will show how mission profile can be made depending on the user requirements.
A list of mission segements that can be analyzed for this code are 
``TAXI-IN``, ``TAKEOFF``, ``CLIMB``, ``CRUISE``, ``DESCENT``, ``LANDING``, ``LOITER``, ``TAXI-OUT`` segements.

A complete mission profile making is shown below.

.. csv-table:: Sample mission profile.
    :file: sizing/sample_full_mission.csv

``TAXI-IN`` segment, a *duration* and *hybridiation* values need to be provided.

``TAKEOFF`` segment, a *distance* and *hybridization* values need to be provided.

``CLIMB`` segment, a *start-alt*, *end-alt* and *climb_rate* and a *hybridization* paraemter are required to provide.

``CRUISE`` segment, *start-alt* and *end-alt* must be set as same value, and *start* should be also keep as same 

for this sizing stage. *distance* and *hybridization* parameter also need to provide.

``LOITER`` segment, is as same as cruise segemet, but only *duration* need to provide and a *hybridiation* factor.

``DESCENT`` segement, is also need to provide for *start-alt*, *end-alt* and *climb_rate* and a *hybridization* paraemter are required to provide.

``LANDING`` segement, a *distance* and *hybridiation* parameters are required to provide. 

``TAXI-OUT`` segment, a *duration* and *hybridiation* values need to be provided.



Vertical Takeoff and Landing Mission Profile
----------------------------------

This section will show how mission profile can be made depending on the user requirements.
A list of mission segements that can be analyzed for this code are 
``TAXI-IN``, ``VTOL-CLIMB``, ``HOVER``, ``CLIMB``, ``CRUISE``, ``DESCENT``, ``VTOL-DESCENT``, 
``LOITER``, ``TAXI-OUT`` segements.

A complete mission profile making is shown below.

``TAXI-IN`` segment, a *duration* and *hybridiation* values need to be provided.

``VTOL-CLIMB`` segment, a *start-alt*, *end-alt* and *climb_rate* and a *hybridization* paraemter are required to provide.

``HOVER`` segment, a *start-alt*, *end-alt* and *duration* paraemter are required to provide.

``CLIMB`` segment, a *start-alt*, *end-alt* and *climb_rate* and a *hybridization* paraemter are required to provide.

``CRUISE`` segment, *start-alt* and *end-alt* must be set as same value, and *start* should be also keep as same 

for this sizing stage. *distance* and *hybridization* parameter also need to provide.

``LOITER`` segment, is as same as cruise segemet, but only *duration* need to provide and a *hybridiation* factor.

``DESCENT`` segement, is also need to provide for *start-alt*, *end-alt* and *climb_rate* and a *hybridization* paraemter are required to provide.

``VTOL-DESCENT`` segment, a *start-alt*, *end-alt* and *climb_rate* and a *hybridization* paraemter are required to provide.

``TAXI-OUT`` segment, a *duration* and *hybridiation* values need to be provided.
