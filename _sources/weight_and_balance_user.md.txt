# weight and balance user manual
# Integrated Analysis User Manual

This is a user manual for integrated analysis of modules inside CADE-MDA.

<br>

To run the integrated analysis, two main input files are necessary. Detailed descriptions, formatting guidelines, and an example file for these input files can be found in here : (1) Command Input File, [here](cmd_input.rst) and (2) Aircraft Input File, [here](config_input.rst).

Get initial (minimum) aircraft data (configuration, weight and propulsion component data) from main ***'Aircraft Input File***. 

After defining the aircraft's basic data in the ***'Aircraft Input File'***, the integrated analysis settings are specified in the ***'Command Input File'***.

### `weight-and-balance`
Weight and Balance module requires methodology settings for 1 type of analyses :

- ***(1) Weight Estimation Methodology Setting***
    - 5 different types of aircraft weight estimation methods are provided

    <br>

        analysis method : Raymer/Torenbeek/USAF/AFDD/Wetted_Area_Structural

- ***(2) Wetted Area Structural Method Setting***
    - If **Wetted_Area_Structural** method is selected, the following inputs are required: 
     
    <br>
    
        avg_material_density_fuselage : Average fuselage skin material density [kg/m^2]
        avg_material_density_wing : Average wing skin material density [kg/m^2]
        avg_material_density_tail : Average empennage skin material density [kg/m^2]
        avg_skin_thickness_fuselage : Average fuselage skin thickness [m]
        avg_skin_thickness_wing : Average wing skin thickness [m]
        avg_skin_thickness_tail : Average empennage skin thickness [m]



- ***(3) Default Parameter Setting***
    - The following fields are auto‚Äêpopulated with default values for the four supported methods (Raymer, Torenbeek, USAF, AFDD) but can be edited if you need to override them:
    - For detailed definitions and recommended values, refer to [Weight and Balance Theory Manual](weight_and_balance_theory.md)

    - Fuel Mass
        - Fuel mass in kilograms.  
        - For electric aircraft, set this to `0`.

    <br>

        mass-fuel: Fuel Weight (kg)  

    - Raymer/Torenbeek/USAF Fudge Factors
  
        - These correction factors adjust baseline component weights to account for advanced materials, and manufacturing allowances.
        
    <br>

        corr_factor_raymer_material_wing: 0.85  
        corr_factor_raymer_material_tail: 0.83  
        corr_factor_raymer_material_fuselage: 0.90  

    - AFDD Technology Factors
        - These correction factors reflect advanced materials and technology maturity.
         
    <br>

        corr_factor_afdd_technology_wing: 0.73  
        corr_factor_afdd_technology_horizontal_tail: 0.65  
        corr_factor_afdd_technology_vertical_tail: 0.79  
        corr_factor_afdd_technology_V_tail: 0.65  
        corr_factor_afdd_technology_fuselage: 0.89
