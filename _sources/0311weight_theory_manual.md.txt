**Weight and Balance Theory Manual**
=============

This is a theory manual for weight and balance analysis.  
It is written by referring to the books:

> [1] FAA, "Weight and Balance Handbook"

# **Weight and Balance**
Weight and center of gravity directly influence an aircraft’s stability and performance. Therefore, the following points must be considered when designing an aircraft:

> 1. Comply with relevant FAA and EASA certification requirements.
> 2. Determine the maximum allowable weight based on the lift provided by the wings (or rotor) under operating conditions, ensuring the aircraft’s structural strength can safely accommodate it.
> 3. Carefully establish the ideal center of gravity (CG) for operation, then derive the allowable CG range so that it remains within this limit throughout operation.

Accordingly, this module supports the design process by predicting the weight of each aircraft component. Based on these predictions, it calculates both the center of gravity and the Moment of Inertia, enabling more efficient evaluation and management of an aircraft’s stability and performance.

## Goal of Weight and Balance

> 1. Predict the weight of each aircraft component to determine compliance with FAA/EASA certification requirements and verify safe operational limits.
> 2. Calculate the aircraft’s center of gravity (CG) to ensure it remains within the safe operating range.
> 3. Compute stability-related moments of inertia (MOI) to provide data demonstrating the aircraft’s safe and stable operation.

# Aircraft Weight (LV.1)

Description:  
Weight is a major factor in airplane construction and operation, and it
demands respect from all pilots and particular diligence by all
maintenance personnel. Excessive weight reduces the efficiency of an
aircraft and the safety margin available if an emergency condition should
arise.

When an aircraft is designed, it is made as light as the required
structural strength allows, and the wings or rotors are designed to
support the maximum allowable weight. When the weight of an aircraft
is increased, the wings or rotors must produce additional lift and the
structure must support not only the additional static loads, but also
the dynamic loads imposed by flight maneuvers. For example, the wings
of a 3,000-pound airplane must support 3,000 pounds in level flight,
but when the airplane is turned smoothly and sharply using a bank angle
of 60 degree, the dynamic load requires the wings to support twice this
or 6,000 pounds.

Severe uncoordinated maneuvers or flight into turbulence can impose
dynamic loads on the structure great enough to cause failure. In
accordance with Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations(14 CFR)
part 23, the structure of a normal category airplane must be strong
enough to sustain a load factor 3.8 times its weight. Every pound of
weight added to a normal category aircraft requires that the structure
be strong enough to support 3.8 pounds. An aircraft operated in the
utility category must sustain a load factor of 4.4 times its weight,
and acrobatic category aircraft must be strong enough to withstand
6.0 times their weight.

# Aircraft Arm (LV.1)

The term arm, typically measured in inches, refers to the distance between the center of gravity (CG) of a component and the chosen datum. If a component’s CG lies ahead of or to the left of the datum, its arm is negative (-); if it is behind or to the right, the arm is positive (+). Placing the datum forward of the entire aircraft means all arms are positive, which helps minimize errors in calculation.

During the design process, engineers define the aircraft’s maximum weight and allowable CG range in inches from the reference plane (the datum). In some designs, this range is stated as a percentage of the mean aerodynamic chord (MAC), where the leading edge is located a specified distance from the datum.

The designer can position the datum at any convenient reference point, such as the leading edge of the wing or a fixed distance from a clearly identifiable location. A common choice is to place the datum a known distance forward of the aircraft—measured in inches from, for example, the nose, the wing’s leading edge, or the engine firewall. This approach ensures consistent, simplified weight and balance calculations.


# Aircraft Moment (LV.1)

Description:  
A moment is a force that tries to cause rotation, and is the product
of the arm, in inches, and the weight in pounds. Moments are generally
expressed in pound-inches (lb-in) and may be either positive or
negative. Figure shows the way the algebraic sign of a moment is derived.
Positive moments cause an airplane to nose up, while negative moments
cause it to nose down.

![sign notations](./fig/aircraft_moment.png)

# Aircraft Center of Gravity (LV.1)

Description:  
Weight and balance problems are based on the physical law of the lever.
This law states that a lever is balance when the weight on one side of
the fulcrum(a pivot point for the lever) multiplied by its arm is equal
to the weight on the opposite side multiplied by its arm. In other words,
the lever is balanced when the sum of the moments about the fulcrum is
zero. This is the condition in which the positive moments(those that try
to rotate it counterclockwise). In an aircraft, the balance point is
referred to as the CG.

One of the easiest ways to understand weight and balance is to consider
a lever with weight placed at various locations. The balance point or CG
of the lever can be changed by either moving the weights closer or
farther from the fulcrum or by increasing or decreasing the weights.
The balance point or CG of a lever may be determined by using these
four steps:

1. Measure the arm of each weight in inches from the datum.
2. Multiply each arm by its weight in pounds to determine the moment in
   pound-inches of each weight.
3. Determine the total of all weights and of all the moments. (Disregard
   the weight of the lever)
4. Divide the total moment by the total weight to determine the balance
   point.

In figure, the datum is located off the lever to the left of weight A.
Using the information provided in figure

![CG calculation](./fig/CG_calculation.webp)

determine the balance point by making a chart like the one in the below
figure. 

![CG calculation table](./fig/CG_calculation_table.webp)

As noted in the above figure, A weighs 100 pounds and is 50 inches from
the datum; B weighs 100 pounds and is 90 inches from the datum; C weighs
200 pounds and is 150 inches from the datum. The total of the weights is
400 pounds, and the total moment is 44,000 lb-in.

Determine the balance point by dividing the total moment by the total
weight. A balance point is equal to the CG and can be mathematically
written as:

$$ CG = \frac{total\;moment}{total\;weight} $$

To prove this is the correct balance, move the datum to a location 110
inches to the right of the original datum and determine the arm of each
weight from this new datum. Then, make a new chart similar to the one in
table. If the balance point is correct, the sum of the moments is zero.

![relocating](./fig/CG_calculation_relocating.webp)

![relocating table](./fig/CG_calculation_relocating_table.webp)

The lever is balanced when the sum of the moments is zero. The location
of the datum used for determining the arms of the weights is not
important; it may be in various locations, but all of the measurements
must be made from the same datum location.

## Basic Weight and Balance Equation (LV.2)

The following formulas can be used to determine the distance weight must
be shifted to obtain a desired change in the CG location. The equation
can also be rearranged to find the amount of weight required to be
shifted to move the CG to a desired location, to find the distance the
CG is moved when a specified amount of weight is shifted, or to find the
total weight that would allow shifting a specified amount of weight to
move the CG a given distance.

$$ \frac{Weight\;to\;be\;shifted}{Total\;weight}=\frac{\Delta\;CG}{Distance\;weight\;is\;shifted} $$
$$ Total\;weight=\frac{Weight\;shifted\;\times\;Distance\;weight\;is\;shifted}{\Delta\;CG} $$
$$ Weight\:shifted=\frac{Total\;weight\;shifted\;\times\;\Delta\;CG}{Distance\;weight\;is\;shifted} $$
$$ \Delta\;CG=\frac{Weight\;shifted\;\times\;Distance\;weight\;is\;shifted}{Total\;weight} $$
$$ Distance\;weight\;is\;shifted=\frac{Total\;weight\;\times\;\Delta\;CG}{Weight\;shifted} $$



# **Weight Breakdown and Calculation (LV.1)**

5.	Miscellaneous:
- Control Systems: These include avionics and flight control systems necessary for the operation and navigation of the aircraft.
- Installation: Refers to integrating and assembling all components into a cohesive and functional aircraft.

In fact, the weightof the propulsion system, excluding the energy source required, was
included as the empty weight.

- Empty Weight
  - Structure weight : airframe, motor boom
  - Propulsion weight : motor, propeller, esc
  - System weight : avionics and electric weight, fuel cell/tank
- Energy Source Weight
  - Battery, (hydrogen)Fuel
- Payload
  - Passengers, Baggage, Camera, etc.


A weight estimation model is a mathematical and empirical method for calculating the mass of each aircraft component and its overall system, derived by analyzing interrelationships among accumulated real flight data and various design parameters (e.g., structural, aerodynamic, and propulsion factors). By using this model from the earliest stages of development, engineers can more accurately predict the expected weight range, thereby enhancing both safety and performance.

The basis for the aircraft weight estimation model is the 'Aircraft Statistical Weights Method' in Raymer's aircraft design book. Other aircraft weight estimation methods, such as Egbert Torenbeek's method in "ADVANCED AIRCRAFT DESIGN," the "USAF" method, and NASA's AFDD Weight Models method in "NDARC NASA Design and Analysis of Rotorcraft," can also be selected for calculation.

In Weight module, the Raymer Weight Estimation Method is used for GA (general aviation) aircraft, the USAF Weight Estimation Method for fighter jets, the Torenbeek Weight Estimation Method for transport aircraft, and the AFDD Weight Estimation Method for tiltrotor and tiltwing aircraft.

# **Moment of Inertia Calculation (LV.1)**

Description:  
Any object that rotates about some axis has a tendency to continue that
motion, just like an object moving along a straight path has a tendency
to move along that path. The former is an example of rotational momentum
and the latter of linear momentum. Unless acted on by some force, both
will continue this motion indefinitely. The tendency of a rotating body
to continue its motion depends on two properties: its mass and the
distance of its CG from the axis of rotation. This leads to the
definition of $mass\;moment\;of\;inertia$ as the property of an object
that is to rotational momentum what mass is to linear momentum.

The moment of inertia of a point mass, $m$, with respect to such an axis
is defined as the object's mass times its distance, $r$, from the axis
squared. (see below figure)

![Aircraft MOI](./fig/aircraft_moi.png)

## Parallel-axis Theorem (LV.2)

Description:  
Consider figure, which shows an arbitrary body rotating about a point other than its CG.

![parallel axis](./fig/aircraft_moi_parallel_axis.png)

The distance between the CG and the axis of rotation, O, is denoted by
$r_{CG}$. The distance from the axis of rotation to the infinitesimal
mass $dm$ is given by $r$ and the distance between it and the CG is
given by $r^{'}$. If the moment of inertia must be evaluated for this
situation, the moment of inertia is given by the following expression.

$$ I_O=mr_{CG}^2+\int_Br^{'}dm=mr_{CG}^2 +I_{CG} $$

*Where,*
$I_{CG}$ : Moment of inertia of the body about its own CG

$r^{'}$ : Distance from CG to an infinitesimal mass $dm$

$r_{CG}$ : Distance from the reference point O to the CG of the body

$m$ : The mass of the body

This equation is referred to as the $parallel-axis\;theorem$. A more
ractical form of it is shown below:

$$ I_{XX}=I_{XX_{CG}}+m(y_{CG}^2+z_{CG}^2) $$
$$ I_{YY}=I_{YY_{CG}}+m(x_{CG}^2+z_{CG}^2) $$
$$ I_{ZZ}=I_{ZZ_{CG}}+m(x_{CG}^2+y_{CG}^2) $$

*Where,*
$I_{XX_{CG}},I_{YY_{CG}},I_{ZZ_{CG}}$ : Moment of inertia of the body
about its own CG

$x_{CG},y_{CG},z_{CG}$ : Distance from the reference point O to the CG
of the body

## Parallel-plane Theorem (LV.2)

The parallel-axis theorem can be extended to the product of inertia in a
similar fashion, in which case it is referred to as the
**parallel-plane theorem**.

$$ I_{XY}=I_{XY_{CG}}+m(x_{CG}^2+y_{CG}^2) $$
$$ I_{XZ}=I_{XZ_{CG}}+m(x_{CG}^2+z_{CG}^2) $$
$$ I_{YZ}=I_{YZ_{CG}}+m(y_{CG}^2+z_{CG}^2) $$

The derivation is similar to that of the parallel-axis theorem.
